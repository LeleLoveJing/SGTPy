What is SGTPy?
--------------

SGTPy is an open-source python package of SAFT-VR-Mie Equation of State (EOS).
SGTPy allows to work with pure fluids and fluid mixtures, additionally the fluids
can be modeled considering association, cross-association and polar contributions.
SGTPy was built on top of phasepy's phase equilibrium and Square
Gradient Theory (SGT) functions. These functions were updated to speed-up
calculations of associative mixtures.

SGTPy relies on Numpy, SciPy and PhasePy.

Getting Started
---------------

.. code-block:: python

      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> from SGTPy import component, mixture, saftvrmie
      >>>> ethanol = component('ethanol2C', ms=1.7728, sigma=3.5592 , eps=224.50,
                    lambda_r=11.319, lambda_a=6., eAB=3018.05, rcAB=0.3547,
                    rdAB=0.4, sites=[1,0,1], cii=5.3141080872882285e-20)
       >>> hexane = component('hexane', ms=1.96720036, sigma=4.54762477,
                               eps=377.60127994, lambda_r=18.41193194,
                               cii=3.581510586936205e-19)
       >>> mix = mixture(hexane, ethanol)
       >>> # fitted to experimental data
       >>> kij = 0.011818492037463553
       >>> Kij = np.array([[0, kij], [kij, 0]])
       >>> mix.kij_saft(Kij)
       >>> eos = saftvrmie(mix)
