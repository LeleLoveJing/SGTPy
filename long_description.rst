SGTPy is an open-source python package of SAFT-VR-Mie Equation of State (EOS).
SGTPy allows to work with pure fluids and fluid mixtures, additionally the fluids
can be modeled considering association, cross-association and polar contributions.
SGTPy was implemented to work with phasepy's phase equilibrium and Square
Gradient Theory (SGT) functions.

SGTPy relies on Numpy, SciPy and PhasePy.
